title: Alway Cherish Your Love for the Ocean!
author: Leonardo Zangrando

How beautiful is the sea of my hometown Trieste! I remember sitting at the end of this quay, looking into the horizon and thinking of yet-to-come great adventures on the sea. And here I am now, living the greatest adventure that is life for the ocean!

Since those days when I was daydreaming, I went into shipbuilding, ports design, maritime startups and eventually ocean sustainability! 

I really love working hard to preserve our oceans and develop sustainable businesses on the ocean, which are very much needed if we want to keep living on our beautiful planet and change our practices before it collapses  under our (so far) irresponsible behaviour.

Whenever I come back to this picture I am reminded of how deep is my love for the ocean and how far back it started!
