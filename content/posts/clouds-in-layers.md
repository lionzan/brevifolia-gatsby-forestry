title: Clouds in layers

Observing the clouds this morning. There are 2 layers of clouds, one very low and moving fast, and another much higher and apparently steady. The apparent speed depends of course on the distance, also the high clouds move, but the tricky question is why two layers?

I recently started to study meteorology to understand the sky and the clouds, and the reason is that the higher layer appears where a warm mass of air catching up with a colder one meet. This is called a warm front and it creates a looooong layer of clouds from where the two masses of air meet at the ground. The clouds develop from that line forward, because the warm air is overtaking the cold air below. Where the two masses touch, there the clouds form. The clouds are wet air coming from above and condensing because it meets colder air below.

And the lower layer of clouds? Well, that's another effect. In a mass of air at constant temperature there is a certain pressure where the air will not be able to keep moisture in and this will become water droplets, that is a cloud. In very moist cold air this limit can be very low. Here's where any convective air motion, that is slightly warmer air moving up, will create clouds. And this is what I could see in the sky above me this morning!
