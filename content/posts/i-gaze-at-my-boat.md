"I gaze at my boat from the top of the mainmast. Her strength, her beauty, her white sails well set on a well found boat. The foam, the wake, the eleven porpoises on either side of the bowsprit. They are black and white porpoises, the most beautiful I know. They breathe on the fly, almost without breaking the surface, without wavering from the course towing Joshua at nearly 8 knots by invisible bonds. Climbing down to fetch the camera is out of question. I would lose everything, and what they give me is too precious; a lens would spoil it all. They leave without my touching them, but the bonds remain."
