title: In the Middle of the Ocean
author: Leonardo Zangrando

That's where I want to be: in the middle of the Ocean!

Well, that's cheating a bit when you are on an island!!! But still. The feeling of vastness of the Ocean views from Gran Canaria is absolutely amazing!

And the constant wind, 'cause Canary Islands are just in the middle of the  North Atlantic trade winds, so electrifying!

I visited Gran Canaria about a year ago and I look forward to when I will visiting again!
