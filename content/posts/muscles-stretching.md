Muscles Stretching! An excellent aid to running.

I do a little stretch to my calves just before starting my run because they tend to be always a bit tense. But careful, when the muscles are cold, stretch them VERY carefully and only if you really need it to avoid injuries while running.

Instead, DO STRETCH your muscles AFTER a run. Make it a habit that you can’t skip. Your muscles will thank you, and so will your posture and general wellbeing.
