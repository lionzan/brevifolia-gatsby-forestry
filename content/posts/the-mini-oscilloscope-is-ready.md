title: The mini oscilloscope is ready!
author: Leonardo Zangrando

---
Almost ready! Last touches to the mini oscilloscope. A few things need to be slightly modified, but I was able to close the box. More pics to follow, and possibly an instructable. Surely a lot of things to show and tell!

* Making a nice shaped box out of laser cut acrylic and plastic tube
* Making a lengthening for the pot axis
* Making a micro probe out of a 2mm plug plus an old... well, probe

Stay tuned :)
