title: What Have You Created Today?
author: Leonardo Zangrando

---
The act of #creation! The most beautiful thing you can do. Create, whatever you create, but do it!

A pretty simple way to create is to cook. Yes, #cooking is a creative act, that you realise by assembling different ingredients and following a process that you can tweak at will.

Yesterday I prepared this oven salmon with potatoes. Delicious! Actually it is one of the quick recipes that I do when I'm short of ideas! And even if it's just a repeat recipe that I do once n a while, it is still an act of creation that I enjoy every time.

Buon Appetito!
