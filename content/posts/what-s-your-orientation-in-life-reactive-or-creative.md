title: What's Your Orientation in Life? Reactive or Creative?
author: Leonardo Zangrando

---
What’s your orientation in life? Do you react to what happens to you, or do you take charge and create your future?

Not a trivial question, which makes all the difference if you want to live a great life.

What is that you want to create FOR ITS OWN SAKE? Not because you want to make money or become famous or please someone, just because being in the process of creating it and then loving the outcome is all that counts!
