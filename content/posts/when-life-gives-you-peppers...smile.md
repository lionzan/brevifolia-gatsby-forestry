title: When Life Gives You Peppers... Smile!
author: Leonardo Zangrando

---
What a surprise cutting a pepper in two and finding...Two smiling faces!

The little joys of cooking! And what a chance it was, since normally I cut peppers along the side not in the middle. But to be honest that was my wife cooking at that time, preparing a succulent plate of peppers filled with rice.

Buon Appetito!
