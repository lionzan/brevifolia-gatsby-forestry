“Where do geese sleep at night?” Mystery solved!

I went out very early for my morning run because the temperature is going to be very hot during the day.

And here’s who I met in the park as soon as they opened it at 7am. All the geese that mysteriously disappear from the river with the high tide. They love to rest in the park for the night!
